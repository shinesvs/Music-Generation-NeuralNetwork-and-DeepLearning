Introduction: 
The implemented Python code forms a significant part of the final project-music generation. 
The primary objective is to process MIDI files, extract musical notes, and utilize an LSTM￾based neural network to generate music. This report provides an overview and breakdown 
of the code's functionality and structure.
Code Overview:
1. Data Extraction and Preparation:
• The code begins by importing necessary libraries and installing required 
packages.
• A specified zip file containing MIDI files is extracted, and the script iterates 
through the extracted folders to collect MIDI file paths.
• Extracted MIDI file paths are stored in a text file for reference.
2. Musical Note Extraction and Processing:
• MIDI files are parsed using the music21 library to extract musical notes and 
chords.
• Extracted notes are stored in a list and serialized using the pickle library for 
further processing.
3. Sequence Preparation for Neural Network:
• Sequences for the neural network are prepared using a defined function that 
maps musical notes to integers.
• One-hot encoding is applied to the output for compatibility with the LSTM 
network.
4. Model Architecture and Training:
• An LSTM-based neural network architecture is defined using the tensorflow.keras 
library.
• The model comprises multiple LSTM and dense layers for learning patterns within the 
musical sequences.
• Training of the model is initiated with defined epochs and batch size, using 
categorical cross-entropy loss and the RMSProp optimizer.
5. Music Generation:
• A function utilizing the trained model generates a sequence of musical notes 
based on the input sequences.
• Generated notes are structured to create a MIDI file using the music21 library.
6. File Handling and Documentation:
• The code also manages file paths, collects relevant information, and saves the 
collected paths into a text file for further reference.
Conclusion: 
The code successfully processes MIDI files, prepares sequences for an LSTM-based model, 
trains the model for music generation, and produces MIDI output.
